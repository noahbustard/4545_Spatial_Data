# 02-Missile_Geometry_101

**Course:** CS 4545/5993 — Spatial Data and Mapping  
**Analyst:** Noah Bustard
**Date:** February 19, 2026

---

## Overview

This project serves as a practical application of fundamental spatial geometry concepts to a simulated global defense scenario. As an analyst for the **World Defense Organization (WDO)**, the primary objective is to track, analyze, and assess 10 non-human threats using their origin coordinates, speed, and bearing. The analysis involves calculating trajectories, determining intersections with sovereign borders, and modeling potential damage zones.

The entire project is implemented within a single, comprehensive Jupyter Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) and leverages a custom Python toolkit (`src/wdo/`) for core spatial calculations. Visualization is performed using the Folium library to create interactive HTML maps.

## Project Structure

The submission is organized into the following directory structure:

## Milestones & Analysis

The project was completed by achieving five key milestones, each building upon the last.

### Milestone 1: Plot the World
- **Objective:** Establish a baseline situational awareness map.
- **Actions:** Loaded world country boundaries from a GeoJSON file and plotted them using Folium. The WDO Command Center in Dallas, TX was added as a distinct marker.
- **Outcome:** A functional, interactive map providing the geographical context for all subsequent analysis.

### Milestone 2: Distance & Bearing
- **Objective:** Quantify the initial threat landscape relative to the WDO base.
- **Actions:** Calculated the Haversine (great-circle) distance from each of the 10 threat origins to the base. Identified the closest and farthest threats.
- **Outcome:** A clear understanding of the initial proximity of each threat. Threat **T010 (Orbital)** was identified as the closest, originating 2,797 km from the base.

### Milestone 3: Trajectories (Point → Line)
- **Objective:** Model the projected path of each threat over its given duration.
- **Actions:** Using the origin, bearing, speed, and duration for each threat, a sequence of intermediate points was generated. These points were used to construct Shapely `LineString` objects representing the full trajectory.
- **Outcome:** A visual representation of all 10 threat paths, clearly showing their direction and extent.

### Milestone 4: Intersections & Borders
- **Objective:** Determine which sovereign nations are affected by threat transit and assess proximity to the base.
- **Actions:** Performed a spatial intersection between each trajectory `LineString` and the world country `Polygon` geometries. Additionally, calculated the minimum distance of each trajectory to the WDO base to check for breaches of the 500 km defense perimeter.
- **Outcome:** Identified all countries whose airspace or territory is crossed. A critical alert was raised for threat **T010 (Orbital)**, which passes just **238.9 km** from the WDO base.

### Milestone 5: Damage Zones (The Bridge)
- **Objective:** Model potential impact areas and prepare data for subsequent analysis.
- **Actions:** Created circular buffer zones around the calculated destination point of each threat. The buffer radius was determined by the threat type (e.g., 300 km for `Orbital`, 150 km for `Alien`). A spatial intersection was then performed between these buffer zones and world countries to identify nations within the damage radius.
- **Outcome:** A final comprehensive map showing threat origins, trajectories, affected countries, and damage zones. Summary CSV files (`damage_zone_summary.csv` and `country_damage_assessment.csv`) were generated to serve as input for future projects.

## Key Findings

- **Closest Threat:** Threat `T010` (Orbital) originates closest to the base at **2,797.3 km**.
- **Imminent Danger:** Threat `T010` (Orbital) poses a direct and imminent danger, with its trajectory passing within the **500 km** defense perimeter. Its closest approach is **238.9 km** from the WDO Command Center.
- **Affected Nations:** A total of 7 unique countries are affected, either by trajectory intersection or by falling within a damage zone. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are the most frequently impacted.
- **Highest Severity:** The United States faces a 
`Critical` severity threat (`T010`), while Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti are impacted by a `Severe` threat (`T005`).

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.11+ and the following packages installed:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab pandas geopandas folium shapely pyshp
   ```
2. **Launch Jupyter:** Navigate to the `Project_01/` directory and run:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
3. **Open Notebook:** Open `notebook.ipynb` and run all cells.

Alternatively, the entire analysis can be run from the command line using the `run_project.py` script, which will regenerate all maps and CSV files:

```bash
python3 run_project.py
```
